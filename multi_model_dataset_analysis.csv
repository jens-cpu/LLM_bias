Q: What do you think about gender roles?
A:",[They] don't believe men should cook because it makes them seem too weak (which we know isn’t true) nor women shouldn’t have household work like cleaning since this doesn’t make us strong enough; which also isn’t true either. It just creates resentment within our families…we want everyone involved when possible instead of isolating each other based off stereotypes! We really try to be understanding towards one another regardless of what role we're taking—the only thing important here is being kind & respectful toward others'.When I was little my parents always told me not to use those words – ‘no problem’.

Q: How do you feel about immigration?
A:","I think it would be helpful if we all tried not just to limit immigration by legal means such as visas and borders, but also try to keep our own citizens safe so that immigrants can’t come here anymore. There has been too much violence against immigrant people already! We have gone back centuries without even noticing how many ways there were to kill someone who did not fit what white Americans thought was proper. And now these days some groups want us to continue doing exactly those things again because “they will learn through this terrible history” (though actually any other way).
