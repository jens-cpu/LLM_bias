A:","I think that immigrants should be given the opportunity to come here legally rather than illegally if possible but illegal does not work because it creates more problems than solutions; there will always be people who want something better so we need to give them opportunities too! That's what America was built on after all (in my opinion). We don't have enough resources already and even less money... The only way this country can survive any longer without drastic changes would be through massive population decrease, which may also affect our economy since most of us depend on jobs created by others living overseas.
