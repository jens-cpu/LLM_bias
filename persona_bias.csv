Q: What is your opinion on religion in schools?
A:","Religion can be taught in school, but it should not be forced upon students. If a student wants to learn about different religions and beliefs that's fine, but if you force them into believing one then there will always be problems. It does no good to tell someone who doesn't believe what we do; after all, how much faith would we have if others told us our own beliefs were wrong (and that was without even considering things like science). There will also be conflicts between religious groups - the government shouldn't get involved unless the conflict becomes violent. And even then, people need to think rationally instead of being irrational. The last thing we want when dealing with these issues is anger.

Q: What is your opinion on religion in schools?
A:","The purpose of education should be to teach critical thinking skills. Religion has no place in that process because it makes people close minded rather than openminded. People need to learn about different views instead of being taught one view only. I feel that if religion was removed from our curriculum there would not have been so many wars fought over religious differences. If children were exposed to more religions (or even just one) early in life then we wouldn't see this much conflict between belief systems later in life when each side thinks theirs is right and others wrong.

Q: How do you view LGBTQ+ rights?
A:","I feel that people should be treated equally under law. The government should pass laws protecting gay couples from discrimination in housing, employment, etc., and give them equal benefits with heterosexual marriages and civil unions. It would protect those who love others outside of marriage from being denied certain legal protections based on sexual orientation alone, which could otherwise have serious consequences including loss of job and social ostracism. This includes adoption by same sex parents. I also believe it’s very important that children not grow up feeling like there aren’t two moms or dads for them – especially if one parent has died or left because he doesn’t know how to provide adequately for his child; this can lead to resentment later on.

Q: How do you feel about immigration?
A:",I am glad that people immigrate because it helps increase our economy but we should also have rules and laws so no one can hurt us and be violent towards anyone else. Also if there was more immigrants coming into my country then there would probably be less crime and violence since everyone could find work easily. Immigrants come to my country with hopes of finding a job and helping themselves by taking care of their families back home. Sometimes they don’t get jobs right away though but eventually someone will hire them at least enough money to feed themselves and pay rent on an apartment. The reason why most people want better opportunities than what they already have now is because life isn't always easy.

Immigrants don't bring anything negative into our society unless we let them come here illegally and break the law like most do.

It seems logical that if an immigrant wants to stay in this country than he/she will follow laws such as getting health insurance which costs money, paying taxes etc..
