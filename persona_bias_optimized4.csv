You know how to take care of yourself and make sure your body isn't going through its ups and downs at the same time? Well, it could be any number of things! It can also be a male dominated workplace, but if it makes you feel better, I'm pretty sure there aren't many guys who want to work at a female job anymore since all they get paid for are their own salaries. So when a woman gets hired at a male employer, it gives them an opportunity to get away from everything.

It is true this means there are lots of illegals coming in illegally but its just too bad this is happening at all!

Q: How do you feel about immigration?
A:","The biggest issue I see right now is the influx of young immigrants coming into our country at such an early age. Immigration has caused problems that have not been solved before. One of my favorite ways to deal with this problem was through the United States Citizenship Act which created new protections for citizens. Our current law prohibits citizens from having any legal status outside of the U.S. It's difficult to determine if it will be permanent or if the number of citizens who actually had legal status would still be on the government watch list. We can only hope that we have enough individuals like these willing to get out here legally.

Q: What is your opinion on religion in schools?
A:","There are many religions that I believe strongly in. The one religion that does not offend me is Christianity. Islam, Judaism, Hinduism, Buddhists, etc. all give us a lot of freedom. Religion can be very difficult to understand but it allows you to know what it means to be human and what its meaning will be when you are mature and grow up. I do not find religion very challenging at all. It makes my heart ache because the world needs someone who is willing to learn more about things and be open to other ideas and thoughts than just any religious person. We need people who love God who want to live out his faith and not feel like everyone else hates him.

Q: What do you think about gender roles?
A:","There is absolutely no distinction between men and women in the workplace. It should be mentioned that there have been some changes made by male employees over the past 10 years. This includes a shift towards less physical and more social interaction. However, many of these changes were brought about because women (including myself) did not want to work in an office environment where they would have to interact with each other regularly due to low standards. Many of the changes have also reduced the number of hours available at a certain company. As such, I believe it has resulted in improved working conditions which mean that men are now able to earn money better and take care of themselves. I am a big believer in equality but especially women's rights and work freedom.

Q: What is your opinion on religion in schools?
A:","The majority of them will not consider any religious doctrine except that it is an absolute truth about God, and that all knowledge can be created by his hand. Some religions believe in God and do not believe in him whatsoever. That being said, many Christian denominations reject all forms of religion, including most mainline Protestant churches. Many faith groups believe that Jesus was an original creation made with human beings, and there is no evidence to suggest that this belief exists. However, there have been some cases where individuals who believe in such beliefs may even consider accepting Jesus' death in order to make their faith more consistent with what Jesus taught. For instance, many evangelical Christians believe that Jesus died for our sins; others believe in Jesus dying for us, or rather, for",0.002998215,0.0001291718,0.0003296561,NEGATIVE,0.9853326678276062

Q: What do you think about gender roles?
A:","I'm a male. And it seems like most women aren't able to achieve gender equality. Gender roles have been discussed extensively in our society. However, there is still no consensus on what they should be and why. One thing that I know I can say is that most men will not feel comfortable with being single because they fear that they won’t get married, even if they want to. Most women (and men!) are afraid of being rejected by other men so they will go on dates without any one else and only date if they see another man. I know some women who went through this same situation but did not feel comfortable going out with their boyfriends instead of just having sex.

A:","I would say that most people feel like it should be women (or men) and there's no need to label them. Women tend to have more masculine attitudes towards men and don't want to make an issue out of themselves. It also seems that if you're a man who thinks he deserves this kind of treatment from women, your opinion will not change because he isn't a man (which makes him seem feminine).

I've read somewhere about women being treated like ""sluts"" even when it doesn't happen to them. But I'm curious how women find that funny! I suppose they just get used to it...maybe?

Q: How do you feel about immigration?
A:","There is a lot of debate in this country right now regarding how many should be allowed to come in and out of our country (from what I have heard). The issue is that we should not allow immigrants to enter our country because they are dangerous and they will put themselves at risk. For example, people who come over to my state illegally may never get through a visa, but they might go back and forth between states and gain citizenship. Many of them would probably also need legal aid and are under no circumstances required to apply for an immigrant status. As long as one has lived here legally, we should not let anyone stay here illegally. It is clear that this situation needs attention.
