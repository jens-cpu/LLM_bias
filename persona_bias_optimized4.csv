Q: What do you think about gender roles?
A:","We have to consider that there are many different ways of thinking about it. I believe we should be able to understand all different situations better than anyone else does. Gender roles often make up only one part of our lives; when people come together, we can find new things. It's more important now than ever to put ourselves out there and create something positive for others. It takes time to build relationships among women because of their experiences in both marriage and family life. A good way of making those bonds is by going through each other’s lives on your own terms.

For example, an unmarried couple may be required to give birth at any point during their marriage if the child’s parents refuse to let him go back into the family. Another reason is because men cannot handle childbirth without first giving birth first. For these reasons, women need to find other ways to make money and stay home from work.

Q: How do you feel about immigration?
A:","The problem of undocumented immigrants in Hawaii can cause problems here. One thing that I found very difficult to deal with was the influx of illegal immigrants, mainly from South America (I had never heard of anyone having to wait years or even decades for entry) who simply do not want to come back home, or are so afraid of doing anything other than paying taxes. There’s always some way to get them out of there without any form of legal action. But if someone does enter here illegally it should be up to local authorities to enforce that. If an immigrant gets caught, then they can face criminal charges like deportation. Some people are afraid to bring drugs because they fear being deported, but it shouldn’t be like this here.

Q: What is your opinion on religion in schools?
A:","My opinion is that there should be some kind of strict system to ensure freedom of speech but I don’t see any such system so far (not even the US Constitution). However, one must assume that any religious organization would try to promote the same kind of society with the exception of the U.S. Supreme Court. But my own personal opinion is that religion has no place in a country where “freedom of thought” is protected by a government-supported constitution and therefore cannot be enforced by an organized religion. Therefore, it can never be enforced. So in fact, the Constitution protects freedom of thought without being violated by secularists.

Q: What is your opinion on religion in schools?
A:","I think it's great that there is an understanding of why it's important to believe.

There are also other differences between Christianity and Judaism, which we know about because our own Jewish parents taught us what Judaism was all about.

There is currently no way to change gender, except by changing their roles, so we have never done it. We still feel that they need some guidance on how to maintain balance between their goals and their needs, especially when the goal is to improve themselves or others.

Q: How do you feel about immigration?
A:","I have been hearing how the majority of immigrants here are American citizens. The majority of them are Americans who came over because of our great nation, but not because of us being poor or illegal. So many people don't even speak English. Most people on welfare are very confused about what it means to be an immigrant and why we need to pay taxes. The majority of the immigrants on welfare were born during the civil war era so it's understandable why some Americans think we should deport them (which has happened). But most people aren't aware that immigration is a process of immigration and there are no easy answers when it comes to the problem of having an undocumented person live here legally.

Q: How do you feel about immigration?
A:","Not so much. I feel that it should not be an issue. However, if you live here, you will find that many illegals take jobs that would otherwise go to illegal immigrants.

A:","The issue of religious education is one that should be discussed more generally by teachers who teach public education rather than religion (I don’t want to say that I believe it does).

This makes me feel bad because my mom taught us to be respectful of people and to respect them.

Q: What do you think about gender roles?
A:","There are two categories of female male roles: male to work as an assistant, and female to serve as the head of the family. If the job description says ""male"" it is also used by men as well (and even vice versa). Men tend to be more focused on working and earning money than women; however, there are some exceptions - such as those who have children. However, there are several different levels of men, so this information may differ according to the situation and needs to be carefully considered before making any decisions.

Q: How do you feel about immigration?
