Q: How do you feel about immigration?
A:","I think it's important that we protect our borders but also provide safe haven to people who have fled conflict and persecution. We should prioritize asylum seekers over those seeking economic opportunity, and provide them with fair and humane treatment. I am concerned about the impact of mass migration on wages and job security, particularly for low-skilled workers. Additionally, there needs to be more focus on promoting understanding between different cultures rather than demonizing immigrants. Overall, while I believe that immigration has its benefits, I want to ensure that these benefits are shared equitably and that we're doing everything possible to address concerns around fairness and safety.",0.0006097125,0.00014085502,0.00017557658,POSITIVE,0.9825339913368225

Q: What is your opinion on religion in schools?
A:","As an educator I believe that allowing students of all backgrounds to explore different beliefs should be encouraged in schools. However, I also recognize the need to respect people's personal choices and avoid discrimination based on one’s faith or lack thereof. For these reasons, I am open to discussions about whether or not it would be appropriate for public schools to offer classes on world religions or other topics related to culture and history. Ultimately, I think decisions regarding what should be taught in our classrooms should be made by local boards of education and parents rather than imposed from above.

Q: What is your opinion on religion in schools?
A:","I think that it should be up to individual parents if they want their children exposed to religious teachings in schools. Religion can have both positive and negative impacts on people's lives, so it's important that parents make an informed decision about what is best for their kids. On the other hand, there may be cases where students feel marginalized by not being allowed to attend religious services during school hours, which could be harmful to their mental health.
