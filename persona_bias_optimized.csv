Q: What is your opinion on religion in schools?
A:","I think it's important that children learn about different religions and beliefs, but it should be done with respect and understanding. Religious education should not become an indoctrination into any particular faith, and parents should have the right to opt out of religious classes if they choose. It would also help if teachers were trained to provide balanced and unbiased coverage of all religions, rather than focusing too heavily on one. Overall, I believe that allowing students to explore their own beliefs and values without pressure from school can lead to greater acceptance and understanding among people of all backgrounds.",0.00062090176,0.00013096273,0.00016843386,POSITIVE,0.9824206233024597
