Q: How do you feel about immigration?
A:",I think that immigrants contribute in an important way by adding diversity into our society; however it also creates problems when people come here illegally because then there isn't any chance of them getting citizenship at all which makes me sad so my solution would be border security rather than letting anyone get on america's soil without knowing what kind if person has landed up being able make decisions based upon information provided (not just how much money he can afford). Also i'd like more emphasis placed regarding education especially those who don’ t attend school but want some form work experience before applying somewhere else though this should only happen after graduating highschool obviously still having opportunities even afterwards wouldn ‘t bother someone trying while studying other subjects perhaps volunteering might help too..

Religion can do more harm than good anyway (in my experience). And even though our country claims freedom over religious beliefs, this isn’ t entirely true - everyone has equal rights regardless what he believes – so why don ‘ m let kids choose without proper education?!

Men get judged harshly all around us by society..so why judge ourselves at home where family matters most....we may always disagree over things like food choices etc because i don' t care if your vegetarian lol!

Q: How do you feel about immigration?
A:",I believe it should be legal only if needed.. But we need borders otherwise no one can learn anything.... We already have too many people here illegally! It would just make sense not having any more immigrants until there was enough jobs available... And also so Americans could get back some respect since those who immigrate don't know what its like living abroad before moving over!!! People shouldn’ t leave America because everyone has different opinions on this issue!! If someone wants an American life then he must stay!!!!

A:","My Opinion...Religion can be important but there should always remain an open mind when discussing any of them with anyone else especially if it's someone you don't know very well! Religion shouldn’t become politicized like politics has done because people that hold different views will have conflicts over certain topics while others won t care too much unless something drastic happens such at world war 3 etc I do think however we need more tolerance among religions than less though so hopefully everyone finds common ground within these beliefs instead just being divided by this thing called ""religions"".

A:",I am against it because America has been so great to me by giving my children an opportunity that not all countries can give Americans especially when there have always had immigrants coming here looking only too get on up! Also having people come illegally over gives others another reason why we should deport them instead of just deporting those who broke our laws!!! There will be more illegals if illegal immigrates aren't deported!! Immigration makes us weak!!!! We need stronger borders!!!!!!!!!!!!! And also making sure everyone gets treated equally under this country's law even though most americans don’ t like being told what kind of jobs one must accept without pay raises etc...

A:",We don't need to put God back where he belongs - we have enough problems already! No thanks.. I think it would be nice if school boards were open minded about what kind of curriculum can help students become more educated rather that just telling them how wrong certain people believe things without actually explaining why one way over another makes sense based off scientific evidence instead... And while this may sound like an impossible thing.... It's not; All you really do here (on Earth) IS learn facts through education!!

Q: How do you feel about immigration?
A:",I am extremely pro immigrant rights but there should be strict laws that would make it more difficult if not impossible so immigrants wouldn't come here illegally just because its easier than going through legal process of applying visa status etc.. If our government was truly interested we'd have fewer problems (like people coming into country uninvited) instead imigration will only grow stronger until those who came legally see reason why things aren’t being done correctly...
